The Hostel Management System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline hostel operations through automation and digital record management. The system replaces traditional manual registers and spreadsheets by providing a centralized platform for managing students, rooms, and daily attendance efficiently.

This application is built using the MERN stack and focuses on improving operational transparency, reducing manual effort, and enhancing data accuracy for hostel administrators.
